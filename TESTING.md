# Safe Drive UK Driving School - Testing Documentation

**Testing Strategy**
The testing strategy for Safe Drive UK is **user-story driven** and follows a **mobile-first** approach.

**Core principles:**

- Every feature is tested against its Acceptance Criteria before being marked complete.
- Testing is performed on real devices and browser DevTools to simulate real users.
- Accessibility and performance are treated as equally important as visual design.
- All testing is documented with evidence (screenshots saved in a `/testing-screenshots` folder in the repo).
- Bugs are logged immediately and re-tested after fixes.

**Testing types used:**

- Manual functional testing
- Responsiveness testing
- Accessibility & SEO checks
- HTML/CSS validation
- Cross-browser compatibility
- User-story validation
